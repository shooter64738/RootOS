A fully automated, no compromise, plant growing system.

There are 3 primary goals to achieve with this project.

1. Makle plant grow automations more accessible to the infirm, disabled, ill. This requires a system that can run on its own for days/weeks/months at a time without human interaction. It must be reliable, robust, and self sufficient.
2. Be a complete all encompassing system. This requires controlling irrigation and nutrients (fertigation) lighting, humidity, temperature, air conditioning, ventilation, exhaust air, fresh air, soil conditions, pest control, plant health, and anything else that we think of...
3. Affordability! Most grow systems on the market hit some of the point in item2, but not all of them. It would cost a fortune to put together a system using commercial equipment ($30,000USd or more). We know because We have done it and it wasn’t cheap. You are left with a fractured system, that covers some things, and not others, and none of it integrates seamlessly.


With all that in mind, we are releasing the fertigation system first, because it seems to be the most overlooked aspect of plant growing. More modules will follow as they become completed. 

The HMI (Human Machine Interface) is designed to run on a Windows platform. It is specifically designed to work best on a touchscreen device such as a tablet or laptop, but it can be run on any Windows PC that supports Windows 10 or 11. We did this because:
1. Windows in a very common operating system, almost every household or business has one.
2. It readily supports the AI (Artificial Intelligence) that we needed to fill goal 1 above. Yes there are Raspberry pi systems that are very capable, but they simply don’t have the computing power needed to run a robust AI model to make this all work as we have envisioned.
3. For those less tech savory constructing a Raspberry PI system with a touch screen, configuring it to run the PI Linux version, and getting it all setup is not for everyone.

Please read the wiki pages for details about the modules available.
